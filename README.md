Sorting Visualizer
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This web-based project visualizes popular sorting algorithms, allowing users to see how sorting algorithms work step by step. Users can adjust the speed of the visualization and observe the swapping of elements in real-time with unique color highlights.

üé® Project Features
Sorting Algorithms Included:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Custom Features:

Adjustable speed control to slow down or speed up the sorting process.
Real-time visualization of the sorting process with color highlights for elements being swapped.
Ability to generate a new array for each sorting attempt.
üñ•Ô∏è Demo
Live Demo (If you have deployed it, link your website here)


üîß Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the visualizer.
CSS: Styling of the sorting bars, container, and controls.
JavaScript: Logic for implementing and visualizing the sorting algorithms.
üì¶ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/HarshitSuthar1/Sorting-Visualizer.git
Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the visualizer.

No server setup is required, just open the file and you're ready to go.
üöÄ How to Use
Select a Sorting Algorithm: Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Generate New Array: Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a random array of bars.
Adjust Speed: Use the speed slider to control the speed of the sorting process.
Start Sorting: Click the "Sort" button to visualize the chosen sorting algorithm.
Example
Choose Quick Sort from the dropdown.
Adjust the speed slider.
Click Sort and watch how the bars are rearranged in real-time!
‚öôÔ∏è Sorting Algorithms Explained
1. Bubble Sort:
Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. Selection Sort:
Finds the smallest element and moves it to the correct position iteratively.
3. Insertion Sort:
Builds a sorted array by inserting elements into their correct position.
4. Merge Sort:
Divides the array into halves and merges sorted halves.
5. Quick Sort:
Picks a pivot element and partitions the array around it.
üìä Speed Control
You can control the speed of the sorting process using the speed slider.
Lower speed values will make sorting slower, allowing for detailed observation of each step.
Higher speed values will speed up the sorting process.
üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
Add more sorting algorithms like Heap Sort, Radix Sort.
Provide additional customization options for bar colors and sizes.
Implement step-by-step control for more interactive learning.
Add detailed algorithm explanations next to the visualization for educational purposes.
